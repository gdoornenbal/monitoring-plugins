# monitoring-plugins
Here i put some created or modified monitoring plugins voor nagios/opsview/icinga

#check_snmp_mem

An old but usefull check for cisco, procurve and linux.  As we had also use hpux, i added that one to, instead of using another plugin.

#check_snmp_storage

This one was already for linux and windows. Added also hpux.  Same writer had another plugin for that, which was almost the same. so i put them together.
